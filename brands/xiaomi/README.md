# Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO

- Verdict: **‚õî Avoid!**

In the past, Xiaomi allowed most of its devices to be unlocked after a period of 7+ days (depending on how new the device is).

With the launch of Xiaomi's new Android fork, HyperOS, they have introduced a number of changes to the unlock process, with new device limits and Mi Account requirements.

### China

[The bootloader CANNOT be unlocked on devices of the Mainland China region](https://gsmchina.com/xiaomi-will-no-longer-allow-bootloader-unlocking-5618/).

### Global

> [!WARNING]
> Since October 2024 [there have been rumors that Xiaomi will kill bootloader unlocking on the Global market](https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1841901853073953254), after having done so for the China market. If you own a Xiaomi device and your warranty has ended or you don't care for it, you should unlock youe device while you can.

While not as extreme, if [xiaomiui.net][global-requirements] is to be believed, global unlock has also undergone some changes:
* Your Mi Account has been active for more than 30 days.
* Xiaomi Community App version 5.3.31 or above.
* You can only unlock the bootloader of 3 devices per year with your account.

## Android One

* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)

Devices shipping with Android One do NOT have any unlock requirements. They follow the standard Android unlock process.
