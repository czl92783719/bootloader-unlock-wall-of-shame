# Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO

- Verdict: **‚õî Avoid!**

In the past, Xiaomi allowed most of its devices to be unlocked after a period of 7+ days (depending on how new the device is).

With the launch of Xiaomi's new Android fork, HyperOS, they have introduced a number of changes to the unlock process, with new device limits and Mi Account requirements.

### China

> [!NOTE]
> The specifics of what can and cannot be done change over time and different sources claim different things depending on the time period.

Currently it is near impossible to unlock Xiaomi phones of the china region, especially if you are outside China and imported the phone.

- [This source][bootloader-unlock-block-mainland-china] claims that the final day one could use the provided form to request an unlock was September 9, 2024. It also has an update, it seems that Xiaomi is suggesting inside the Community App that they will bring back the service in 2025, but it wouldn't be the first time a company lied about this.
- In various forum posts [like this one][bootloader-unlock-block-mainland-china-alt] it is mentioned that a china region phone can only be unlocked if one is situated in China and has a level 5 Xiaomi account, or pays for the service in the hopes that a technician can unlock it.

### Global

> [!WARNING]
> Since October 2024 [there have been rumors][bootloader-unlock-block-global] that Xiaomi will kill bootloader unlocking on the Global market, after having done so for the China market.
>
> If you own a Xiaomi device and your warranty has ended or you don't care for it, you should unlock your device while you can.

While not as extreme, if [xiaomiui.net][global-requirements] is to be believed, global unlock has also undergone some changes:
* Your Mi Account has been active for more than 30 days.
* Xiaomi Community App version 5.3.31 or above.
* You can only unlock the bootloader of 3 devices per year with your account.

## Android One

* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)

Devices shipping with Android One do NOT have any unlock requirements. They follow the standard Android unlock process.
